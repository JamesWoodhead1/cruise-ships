## Cruise Ships

This is a JavaScript project as part of the Software Engineering Fasttrack course at Manchester Codes. I have created the JavaScript code to simulate cruise ships sailing around the world and docking at ports along the way. I intend to add a GUI to diplay the cruise ships, ports and journey in the browser.

## General Info

The purpose of this project is to build on the following skills;
Domain Modelling
User Stories
Object-oriented Programming
DRY
Single Responsibility Principle
Dependency inversion
Test doubles and test isolation
DOM manipulation


## Technologies
JavaScript

Node
Node Package Manager
Git
GitHub
HTML
CSS
Normalize.css
ESLint

## Features
There are three classes that can interact with each other to simulate cruise ships as they travel around the globe.

Ship object will have itinerary and port objects. Ships can set sail and dock at ports.
Ports will hold records of the ships that are currently docked. 
Itineraries contain information about the current and previous ports that the ships have visited and will be visiting.
